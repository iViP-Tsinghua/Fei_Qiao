		<font face="Times New Roman" color="#C0C0C0"><b>Abstract:</b> Bandwidth 
		requirement and energy consumption of memory accesses are always the 
		bottlenecks of the system performance in high-speed mass data processing 
		systems. Cost-constrained high definition video decoding system is a 
		typical one that is bothered by the frequent and random memory accesses. 
		Efficient schemes of embedded compression (EC) and memory access 
		management are proposed and implemented to resolve the problem of memory 
		bottleneck for video decoding systems. Embedded compression is an 
		attractive strategy to reduce the amount of memory accesses between the 
		processing core and external memory in video decoder. A lossless and 
		low-cost dictionary-based EC algorithm is proposed for high definition 
		MPEG-2 video decoder. About 50% of data storage can be reduced with the 
		EC schemes, which is approximate to the previous lossy schemes. 
		Synthesized with HJTC 0.18&micro;m CMOS technology, the number of occupied 
		logic gates for EC encoder and EC decoder are 13K and 4K respectively, 
		less than 5% of that of the video decoder. Moreover, an efficient 
		5/3-DWT based EC algorithm is proposed for H.264 decoder, and 70% of 
		memory accesses can be reduced. This EC algorithm is more efficient than 
		the existing schemes while maintaining comparable video quality. In this 
		algorithm, each 4×4 pixel array is compressed into 64-bit or 32-bit 
		segments to heighten the data bus utilization. Reference pixel fetching 
		mechanism in motion compensation is the key point for the integration of 
		EC schemes in video decoder. Boundary judgment and dual-mode boundary 
		joint schemes are proposed for MPEG-2 and H.264 decoder respectively to 
		provide seamless integration for the block-based EC approaches. And the 
		new concept of EC and motion compensation combination design is 
		proposed. In addition, the dual-mode boundary joint scheme can reduce 
		the rate of fetched redundancy pixels involved in EC schemes to only 
		about 10%. In the aspect of memory access management, an efficient 
		window-based frame storage architecture is proposed, and about 90% of 
		the latency of page breaks (row activation and precharge) can be reduced 
		compared to the traditional linear storage architecture. Moreover, 
		multi-port SDRAM controller is used in the VLSI video decoder to perform 
		the frequent memory accesses. Group-access-based response and no 
		redundancy accessing schemes are adopted in the dedicated memory 
		controller to reduce the number of row-activation operations, and 75% of 
		buffer size is also saved compared to the previous works. Finally, the 
		proposed lossless EC algorithm and boundary judgment reference pixel 
		fetching scheme are integrated into an MB-level three-stage-pipelined 
		MPEG-2 video decoder. The whole video decoder with EC engine is verified 
		and tested based on Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA platform, and can reduce 25% 
		of power dissipation when decoding the bit streams of CIF format. It is 
		confirmed that the proposed schemes are efficient for resolving the high 
		memory bandwidth and high power consumption problems in the 
		cost-constrained high-speed data transfer systems. </font>

		the technological advancements in embedded system design, chip 
		manufacturing, the coming-of-age of CMOS image sensors and computer 
		vision analysis algorithms, a new vision sensor ― Smart Camera has 
		attracted significant interest from international industrial 
		organizations and academic research institutions. Smart cameras (also 
		known as smart vision sensor), which integrate image acquisition, image 
		processing and communications capabilities in a single sensor, can 
		complete the pre-set image processing and analysis tasks, extract a 
		higher level of interest data and transfer them to a data center. 
		Therefore, smart cameras can not only have the awareness of the 
		monitoring scene, but also effectively reduce the demand bandwidth for 
		transmission. Compared to the traditional computer vision systems (such 
		as “PC plus camera”), smart cameras as a standalone embedded vision 
		system, have the advantage of smaller size, lower power and lower cost. 
		This paper carried out work on the topic of designing an embedded smart 
		camera platform. The work is as follows: First, analyzed the challenges 
		of smart camera in power, processing capability and resource and 
		proposed a smart camera platform based on multi-port memory controller. 
		This platform adapts hardware structure of FPGA plus CPU, the FPGA can 
		accelerate image processing algorithms and video compression, and CPU 
		mainly to do the system communication and control work. Second, a 
		functional configuration and power management module is added into this 
		smart camera platform. This module can communicate both with the CPU and 
		other hardware modules, and receive control commands from CPU and 
		transfer to image acquisition, processing and communication modules 
		after decoded. The system can be configured to work in different modes 
		(such as sleep, idle, work, etc.) and each module can be open or closed 
		in different modes to effectively save power. Third, according to the 
		characteristics of the SDRAM memory access together with the 
		characteristics of image processing and analysis algorithms, an 
		efficient frame buffer mapping method is designed which can effectively 
		reduce row switch delay of memory access; a read prefetching mechanism 
		based on windows is designed and can effectively improve memory 
		bandwidth utilization with hardly any increase in costs. Finally, the 
		logic simulation and performance analysis result is performed and the 
		system is verified on the XILINX Virtex-6 ML605 FPGA development board.

		the increasing of the clock frequency of digital system, the timing 
		overhead of &#64258;ip-&#64258;ops is taking a larger and larger part of clock period. 
		This leads the application of pipeline technique can only get less clock 
		frequency further improvement but need to pay big price of power 
		consumption. Therefore, this paper is on basis of the design method of 
		low-power and high-speed soft-edge &#64258;ip-&#64258;ops, intimately connecting with 
		the low power techniques and soft-edge techniques in &#64258;ip-&#64258;op design, 
		carried out four parts of work: &#8226; In this work, a low power delay 
		element is proposed. The simulation results with the technology of smic 
		90nm shows that compared to the conventional inverter chain, this 
		element can obtain 60ps delay with 37% less power consumption. Based on 
		it, a low power NOR gate and NAND gate is also proposed. Compared to the 
		corresponding complementary CMOS gate, their power reduction is 33% and 
		28% respectively, the application of the NOR gate in the Flip-Flop 
		design results in an obvious of power reduction of the &#64258;ip-&#64258;op. &#8226; On the 
		basis of Conditional Capture Flip-Flop, two improved structures of 
		circuit are proposed. They are improved Conditional Capture Flip-Flop (imCCFF) 
		and conditional keeper CCFF(ck-CCFF). The imCCFF Flip-Flop can fully 
		eliminate the redundant power of pulsed triggered &#64258;ip-&#64258;op so as to get 
		more power reduction While ck-CCFF avoids the problem of signal 
		contention in the output port through the utilization of conditional 
		keeper techniques, so it can decrease the power and latency of the &#64258;ip-&#64258;op. 
		&#8226; Proposed a new structure of pulse-triggered Flip-Flop (PAPTFF) which 
		utilizes the low power NOR gate, improved conditional capture technique 
		and conditional keeper technique. Therefor it not only features low 
		power and high speedbut also has the property of soft edge. The 
		simulation with the technology of smic 90nm illustrates that it’s power 
		consumption is 5.7 W when the input activity is 0.2. It’s delay is 55ps, 
		Compared to the other &#64258;ip-&#64258;ops, it has very low power consumption and 
		short delay. &#8226; Layout implementation of PAPTFF is completed and also a 
		standard cell library is created on it. The post-simulated result shows 
		that compared to the corresponding cell in the ordinary library, its 
		power reduction is 37% and delay reduction is 47%. And also based on the 
		library, the adder with di&#64256;erent pipeline depth is designed. Compared to 
		the standard cell library of smic 90nm technology its max frequency 
		increase is 25% and power reduction is 24%, which fully illustrated the 
		validation of PAPTFF in the system design. </font></p>

				<b>Abstract:</b> In order to meet the growing demand for 
				large-size high-definition video, high-definition digital TV 
				(HDTV) is coming into prevalence in the near future. Due to its 
				overwhelming compression performance and high encoding image 
				quality, the fashionable video coding standard H.264 
				particularly suits to encoding HDTV. However, H.264 great 
				encoding complexity brings on huge throughput requirements when 
				encoding the real-time video. Therefore, the ASIC 
				implementations of H.264 encoders are the indubitable trends. 
				After the introduction of the overall H.264 encoder framework, 
				the thesis focuses research attention on transform coding part 
				and entropy coding part of the encoder. Firstly, the key of 
				increasing throughput is analyzed and efficient algorithms are 
				proposed. Secondly, the corresponding RTL-level architecture is 
				simulated in which the pipeline and parallel technology is being 
				widely used. Finally, the Transform-and-Quantization Module, the 
				Inverse Quantization Inverse Transform Module and the 
				Context-based Adaptive Variable Length Coding Module (CAVLC) are 
				synthesized with SMIC 0.18μm CMOS technology, and then verified 
				by VCS. The three modules work correctly and the data throughput 
				is in full compliance with HD1080 video format (1920 × 1088 
				@30fp) requirements. Taking advantage of the characteristics of 
				the block coefficients, a novel inverse quantization and inverse 
				transform architecture for H.264 encoder is proposed. With a 
				view to module-reuse and complexity-reduction, the procedure of 
				inverse quantization is merged into the step of inverse 
				transform where the 2×2 chroma DC inverse Hadamard transform, 
				the 4×4 luma DC inverse Hadamard transform and the IDCT process 
				are mapped into one single pipeline architecture. Compared with 
				previous structures, the performance of the proposed module was 
				improved by 35.9%. In order to overcome the throughput 
				bottleneck, a highly parallel and double-level pipeline CAVLC 
				encoder is proposed in the thesis. The module adopts 
				four-channel parallel scan instead of serial process. In 
				addition, by using FIFO, the processing delay of each stage is 
				averaged to insure higher efficiency of block-level pipeline. 
				The data throughput of the proposed design increases to 3.46 
				times as much as that of previous structures, which can even 
				meet the requirements of real-time processing of digital cinema 
				video (4096 × 2048 @30fp). Moreover, a DSP-based real-time 
				transcoder is implemented in the thesis, which makes it possible 
				when playing H.264-based television program on H.263-based 
				multimedia terminals. Focusing on the reduction of computation 
				complexity, the proposed transcoder makes the most of the side 
				information such as motion vectors or reference frames and 
				adopts a novel architecture which spends less computing and 
				storage resources. By taking advantage of the characteristics of 
				TMS320DM642, the improved transcoder is optimized and realized 
				on DSP. The proposed one could process 25 CIF frames per second 
				with negligible degradation of the subjective and objective 
				reconstruction video quality，which can be obviously practical in 
				real world applications. </font></p>

				is a bottleneck in realization of a real-time H.264 encoder. 
				This thesis firstly addresses the software&nbsp; optimization problem

				Besides, error control techniques are studied systematically in

				demonstrate that our proposal provides not only better 
				subjective and objective reconstruction than the other

				sequences and different loss rates. A hierarchical Flexible 
				Macroblock Ordering (FMO) method is also proposed in this 
				thesis, which can be combined well with Region Of Interest (ROI) 
				based error resilient coding schemes with much fewer header bits 
				than the existing FMO schemes in H.264 standard. It achieves a 
				better tradeoff between video compression efficiency and error 
				resilient performance by the hierarchical FMO scheme when the 
				video data are transmitted over error-prone networks based on

				<b>Abstract:</b> As the latest video coding standard, H.264

				supplying paramters and residual data for other parts of the 
				decoder. In this module, several units work sequentially. So 
				with enable signals, idle units can be shut down to reduce the

				<b>Abstract:</b> As the latest video coding standard, H.264

				becoming more and more prevalent. Thereby, it is meaningful to 
				develop low-power IP cores of H.264 decoder with low price for 
				portable devices. For the purpose of designing a H.264 Baseline 
				Level 2.0 decoder in VLSI, this paper focuses on following 
				aspects: 1) The system scheme of the H.264 Baseline Level 2.0 
				decoder has been worked out and the top level architecture has 
				been designed. In this architecture, A 32M Byte DDR is used as 
				the off-chip memory to store the reference frames. There is no 
				pipelined structure involved in the architecture. And the 
				decoder process the data macro-block by macro-block while the 
				sub-modules process the data 4x4 block by 4x4 block inside the 
				decoder. The decoder can process one point every 8 clock cycles. 
				Thus it is able to support CIF@30FPS with a clock frequency of 
				40MHz. 2) A Motion Compensation (MC) Module has been developed 
				which has passed the function verification. When synthesized 
				under SMIC 0.18 &#61549;m technics, it counts about 80000 gates. And 
				the highest process frequency is 83.3MHz. Furthermore, this

				Transform (RO&amp;IQ&amp;IT) Module, Picture Rebuilding (PR) Module and 
				Address Converting (AC) Module. All these modules can work at a

				<b>Abstract:</b> The high-definition digital television (HDTV) 
				replaces the traditional analogue television is an inevitable 
				trend. With the popularity of HDTV, because of its high 
				flexibility and high maturity, MPEG-2 has gained sustaining high 
				attention. Specially, the demand of MPEG-2 MP@HL decoders will 
				definitely grow. This paper presents the design of the motion 
				compensation module, a key part of the MPEG-2 MP@HL decoding 
				application specific integrated circuits (ASIC). The concept of 
				video compression, the theory of MPEG-2 decoders, the design 
				methods of the motion compensation module and an improved method 
				of image stored in the memory is addressed. Motion compensation 
				module is divided into three sub-modules according with their 
				functionality: reading data of prediction, half pixels 
				interpolation, image reconstruction and writing back to the 
				memory. Reading data module includes motion vectors decryption, 
				dual prime prediction, memory address conversion, and reading 
				control; the function of half pixels interpolation is doing 
				horizontal and vertical half-pixel interpolation according to 
				the half pixels index; image reconstruction and writing back to 
				the memory module include reading inverse discrete cosine 
				transform (IDCT) and interpolation data, image reconstruction, 
				memory address conversion, and writing memory. The details of 
				the functions and the realizations of these modules are 
				described in this article. To improve the memory bandwidth in 
				MPEG2 decoder, a new memory storing architecture is proposed. 
				The architecture is based on the character of synchronous 
				dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) and the MPEG2 decoder. 
				Since it can minimize the number of overhead cycles needed for 
				row-activations in SDRAM, we can improve the memory bandwidth 
				significantly. Compared to the linear translation, the results 
				show that it reduces about 90% of row activations and 60% of the 
				cycles needed in decoder. The decoder had been verified by 
				Xilinx Spartan-3 development board. The frequency of decoder is 
				40MHz, and 25MHz in VGA display. In ASIC design, using SMIC 
				0.18μm process, with the highest frequency of 150MHz, which can 
				achieve 1920 x 1080 @30f/s decoding. The size of the chip, 
				including all PADs, is 4.2mm x 4.2mm. </font></p>

				design of Macroblock decoder and VGA interface of the MPEG-2 
				decoder based on MP@HL is presented. First, we deeply analyze 
				the MPEG-2 standard, its syntax structure and the principle of 
				the decoder as a whole. Two kinds of MPEG-2 decoder architecture 
				including block level pipeline architecture and Macroblock level 
				pipeline architecture is introduced and the analysis of the two 
				architectures is also presented. The ASIC design of Macroblock 
				decoder and VGA is described in detail in this paper. Macroblock 
				decoder includes the variable length decoder (VLD) and state 
				machines used to decode the parameter of the encoded stream. The 
				performance of VLD greatly affects the efficiency of the whole 
				MPEG-2 decoder. In this dissertation, several VLD architecture 
				are analyzed and a new high speed parallel VLD is presented 
				which can decode multiple symbols in one clock cycle and reduce 
				the critical path greatly. The function of VGA includes 
				producing the pixel address of SDRAM, up sampling and the color 
				space transform. The format of the MPEG-2 video decoded stream 
				is transformed from the 4:2:0 in YUV to 4:4:4 in RGB. The 
				algorithm of average interpolation is adopted in the ASIC design 
				of the up sampling. At Last, in this dissertation, synthesis, 
				post simulation and static timing analysis for the MPEG-2 
				decoder is introduced. SMIC 0.18 CMOS technology is used in the 
				synthesis using Synopsis DC tool. The result shows that the 
				whole MPEG-2 decoder based on MP@HL has 0.7 M gates and an area 
				of 8.3 mm2 and the fastest system clock frequency can be 150MHz.

		Abstract:</b> Due to the overwhelming technology advantage over analog 
		TV broadcasting, digital TV broadcasting is coming into dominating 
		position in the near future. Digital high-definition TV (HDTV) is then 
		the main developing trend all over the world. Because of its high 
		flexibility of application and maturity of technology, MPEG-2 has been 
		widely adopted as the source coding standard for digital HDTV by many 
		countries, which makes MPEG-2 video decoding one of the key technologies 
		in digital HDTV. The huge volume of digital signal processing required 
		in HDTV video decoding makes it a must to develop a high performance 
		application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for such application. In 
		this paper, we designed the system structure of an MPEG-2 HDTV video 
		decoder based on the quantitative analysis of the work load of the 
		decoder, in which a 3-stage MB-level decoding pipeline was implemented. 
		We also structured the circuit of some key functional blocks in the 
		decoder, such as the inverse scan module, inverse quantizer, inverse 
		discret cosine transform (IDCT), etc. We designed their 
		register-transfer-level (RTL) models with Verilog HDL, and finished the 
		simulation with ModelSim. In the design of IDCT, we used the distributed 
		arithmetic (DA) + cyclic convolution structure to replace all the 
		multiplications in IDCT with look-up-tables (LUT), in which the cyclic 
		convolution algorithm helped to reduce the scale of the LUTs from to , 
		wherein N is the number of input data to IDCT. Besides，we also proposed 
		a multi-port synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) controller 
		in this paper. The multi-port SDRAM controller provided separate read 
		and write datapath for functional blocks in the decoder, which shared 
		the memory bandwidth, respectively, and had an arbiter module 
		incorporated to arbitrate the competition for memory access. The control 
		logic in the controller was optimized to increase the efficiency of the 
		memory bandwidth, which lead to the reduction of hardware resources. 
		Compared to the traditional bus + direct memry access (DMA) structure, 
		the on-chip buffer was reduced by up to 70% by the scheme proposed in 
		this paper. As for system verification, we designed a field programmable 
		gate array (FPGA) verification system on the platform of Xilinx 
		Spartan-3 FPGA. In particular, we developed and optimized a DDR SDRAM 
		controller specially for FPGA platform. The video decoder runs on the 
		FPGA successfully with a system clock frequency of 50 MHz and a memory 
		clock frequency of 100 MHz. In the last part of this paper, Synopsys 
		Astro was emplyed to do floorplan, placement, and routing for the 
		backend design of the video decoder ASIC. The final physical layout 
		features an area of 4.2×4.2 mm2 (PADs included) and a working clock 
		frequency of 108 MHz. </font></p>
