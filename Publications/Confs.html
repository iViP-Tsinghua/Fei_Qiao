		multipliers which could be selectively turned on/off. On-chip sleep 
		signals are extracted from one input signal of the multipliers which has 
		larger dynamic range. By detecting the magnitude of the input signal,

		a simple, efficient, low power off-chip memory design is proposed, which 
		fully exploits the features of DRAM memory and video application, as 
		well as overcomes the drawbacks of algorithm complexity and system 
		modification of embedded compression, which is a popular way to decrease 
		power consumption of the off-chip memory. The integration of the scheme 
		into video decoder will not involve any extra video decoding complexity. 
		It adopts the simple bus-invert encoding scheme. Based on the fact that 
		the power consumption of logic ｀0¨ bit is less than that of logic ｀1¨, 
		bus-invert encoding scheme is applied to the transferring data between 
		video decoder and off-chip memory. Meanwhile, the features of fault 
		tolerance of human eyes and lossy processing of video decoding 
		application are exploited to solve the extra flag-bit of encoder scheme 
		in off-chip SDARM memory, which has the fixed bit width and is less 
		flexible than on-chip SRAM. This scheme is integrated into MPEG-2 
		decoder system. The experiment results show that this scheme can archive 
		20%-35% reduction in power consumption of logic ｀1¨ bit, and the

		embedded processor design for its power efficiency and multi-thread 
		parallelization, and can be used to fit well with the requirements for 
		this decoder. To simulate and evaluate the performance of such

		programming model (OpenMP ) is given,and experiments show that it can 
		effectively simulate the system in a short time and more importantly, it 
		can be used to help analyze the efficiency of each task-parallelization 
		strategy. After optimization, the speedup ratio for each slice decoding 
		can get about 3.06 on average under 4-core multi-core systems. </font></td>

		between 20% and 50%, and has about 8.5% of reduction in power 
		consumption, and is secure at the same time. This paper presents both 
		theoretical analysis and experimental results. In our experiments, the

				computationally intensive placing ever greater demands on power

				techniques.Techniques to realize a low power multimedia application signal 
				processor are presented, namely: (1) a parallel processing DSP 
				for low voltage operation, (2) multi-power domains, and (3) a 
				conditional pre-charge flip-flop. The combination of these low 
				power techniques is able to reduce power dissipation without 
				degrading operation speed and area, and uses only a single power
